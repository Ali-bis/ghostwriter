Ghost Writer Assembly Guide
Phase 1: Putting the Electronics Together
PCB Time: Solder female headers onto the custom PCB carrier board 
Getting the Board Together: Press fit the Seeed Xiao into the headers
First Test: Connect the USB-C and run the 'GhostWriter_Test.ino' test file on my computer to get the motor turning around
Phase 2: Getting the Mechanicals Right
Printing the Bits
Building the Frame: Once i print all the parts, i'll assemble the corners using M3 threaded rods (or smooth rods).
Routing the Belts
Phase 3: Getting Everything Working Together
Mounting the Board: Pop the PCB into the custom standoffs in the custom "Red Box" using M2/M3 screws.
Cable Management: Get the stepper motor cables (there are four of them) into the enclosure and route them neatly through the gantry.
Adding the Pen Lift: Glue or screw the SG90 servo onto the Z-axis carriage - this will get the pen moving up and down.
Final Check: Make sure the USB-C cable can pass cleanly through the custom "U-Slot" in the enclosure wall - a bit of checking and testing before calling it done.
